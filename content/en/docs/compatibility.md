See the following list of compatible Kubernetes distributions and platforms for running the [Spin Operator](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/):

 - [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/)
 - [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service)
 - [Civo Kubernetes](https://www.civo.com/kubernetes)
 - [Digital Ocean Kubernetes (DOKS)](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes)
 - [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
 - [k3d](https://k3d.io)
 - [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) (explicitly pass `--container-runtime=containerd` and ensure you're on minikube version `>= 1.33`)
 - [Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/)

> **Disclaimer**: Please note that this is a working list of compatible Kubernetes distributions and platforms. For managed Kubernetes services, it's important to be aware that cloud providers may choose to discontinue support for specific dependencies, such as container runtimes. While we strive to maintain the accuracy of this documentation, it is ultimately your responsibility to verify with your Kubernetes provider whether the required dependencies are still supported.

### How to validate Spin Operator Compatibility

If you would like to validate Spin Operator's compatibility with a new specific Kubernetes distribution or platform or simply test one of the platforms listed above yourself, follow these steps for validation:

1. **Install the Spin Operator**: Begin by installing the Spin Operator within the Kubernetes cluster. This involves deploying the necessary dependencies and the Spin Operator itself. (See [Installing with Helm]({{< ref "installing-with-helm" >}}))

2. **Create, Package, and Deploy a Spin App**: Proceed by creating a Spin App, packaging it, and successfully deploying it within the Kubernetes environment. (See [Package and Deploy Spin Apps]({{< ref "package-and-deploy" >}}))

3. **Invoke the Spin App**: Once the Spin App is deployed, ensure at least one request was successfully served by the Spin App.

## Container Runtime Constraints

The Spin Operator requires the target nodes that would run Spin applications to support containerd version [`1.6.26+`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.26) or [`1.7.7+`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.7).

Use the `kubectl get nodes -o wide` command to see which container runtime is installed per node:

```shell
# Inspect container runtimes per node
kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                    STATUS   VERSION   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME
generalnp-vmss000000    Ready    v1.27.9   Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS   5.15.0-1056-azure   containerd://1.7.7-1
generalnp-vmss000001    Ready    v1.27.9   Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS   5.15.0-1056-azure   containerd://1.7.7-1
generalnp-vmss000002    Ready    v1.27.9   Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS   5.15.0-1056-azure   containerd://1.7.7-1

```
