Horizontal scaling, in the Kubernetes sense, means deploying more pods to meet demand (different
from vertical scaling whereby more memory and CPU resources are assigned to already running pods).
In this tutorial, we configure
[HPA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) to dynamically
scale the instance count of our SpinApps to meet the demand.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) - for running k3d
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - the Kubernetes CLI
- [k3d](https://k3d.io) - a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that runs on Docker
- [Helm](https://helm.sh) - the package manager for Kubernetes
- [Bombardier](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/codesenberg/bombardier) - cross-platform HTTP
  benchmarking CLI

> We use k3d to run a Kubernetes cluster locally as part of this tutorial, but you can follow these
> steps to configure HPA autoscaling on your desired Kubernetes environment.

## Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster

Run the following command to create a Kubernetes cluster that has [the
containerd-shim-spin](https://github.com/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin) pre-requisites installed: If
you have a Kubernetes cluster already, please feel free to use it:

```console
k3d cluster create wasm-cluster-scale \
  --image ghcr.io/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin/k3d:v0.15.1 \
  -p "8081:80@loadbalancer" \
  --agents 2
```

### Deploying Spin Operator and its dependencies

First, you have to install [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) to
automatically provision and manage TLS certificates (used by Spin Operator's admission webhook
system). For detailed installation instructions see [the cert-manager
documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

```console
# Install cert-manager CRDs
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml

# Add and update Jetstack repository
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update

# Install the cert-manager Helm chart
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.14.3
```

Next, run the following commands to install the Spin [Runtime Class]({{<ref "glossary#runtime-class"
>}}) and Spin Operator [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)]({{<ref
"glossary#custom-resource-definition-crd">}}):

> Note: In a production cluster you likely want to customize the Runtime Class with a `nodeSelector`
> that matches nodes that have the shim installed. However, in the K3d example, they're installed on
> every node.

```console
# Install the RuntimeClass
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.3.0/spin-operator.runtime-class.yaml

# Install the CRDs
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.3.0/spin-operator.crds.yaml
```

Lastly, install Spin Operator using `helm` and the [shim executor]({{< ref
"glossary#spin-app-executor-crd" >}}) with the following commands:

```console
# Install Spin Operator
helm install spin-operator \
  --namespace spin-operator \
  --create-namespace \
  --version 0.3.0 \
  --wait \
  oci://ghcr.io/spinkube/charts/spin-operator

# Install the shim executor
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.3.0/spin-operator.shim-executor.yaml
```

Great, now you have Spin Operator up and running on your cluster. This means you’re set to create
and deploy SpinApps later on in the tutorial.

## Set Up Ingress

Use the following command to set up ingress on your Kubernetes cluster. This ensures traffic can
reach your SpinApp once we’ve created it in future steps:

```console
# Setup ingress following this tutorial https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/usage/exposing_services/
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: hpa-spinapp
            port:
              number: 80
EOF
```

Hit enter to create the ingress resource.

## Deploy Spin App and HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)

Next up we’re going to deploy the Spin App we will be scaling. You can find the source code of the
Spin App in the
[apps/cpu-load-gen](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/tree/main/apps/cpu-load-gen) folder of
the Spin Operator repository.

We can take a look at the SpinApp and HPA definitions in our deployment file below/. As you can see,
we have set our `resources` -> `limits` to `500m` of `cpu` and `500Mi` of `memory` per Spin
application and we will scale the instance count when we’ve reached a 50% utilization in `cpu` and
`memory`. We’ve also defined support a maximum
[replica](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#replicas) count of
10 and a minimum replica count of 1:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.spinoperator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: SpinApp
metadata:
  name: hpa-spinapp
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/spinkube/spin-operator/cpu-load-gen:20240311-163328-g1121986
  enableAutoscaling: true
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 500Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 400Mi
---
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spinapp-autoscaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hpa-spinapp
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 50
```

For more information about HPA, please visit the following links:
- [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod
  Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)
- [Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  Walkthrough](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/)
- [HPA Container Resource
  Metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#container-resource-metrics)

Below is an example of the configuration to scale resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.spinoperator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: SpinApp
metadata:
  name: hpa-spinapp
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/spinkube/spin-operator/cpu-load-gen:20240311-163328-g1121986
  executor: containerd-shim-spin
  enableAutoscaling: true
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 500Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 400Mi
---
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spinapp-autoscaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hpa-spinapp
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

Let’s deploy the SpinApp and the HPA instance onto our cluster (using the above `.yaml`
configuration). To apply the above configuration we use the following `kubectl apply` command:

```console
# Install SpinApp and HPA
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinkube/spin-operator/main/config/samples/hpa.yaml
```

You can see your running Spin application by running the following command:

```console
kubectl get spinapps
NAME          AGE
hpa-spinapp   92m
```

You can also see your HPA instance with the following command:

```console
kubectl get hpa
NAME                 REFERENCE                TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
spinapp-autoscaler   Deployment/hpa-spinapp   6%/50%    1         10        1          97m
```

> Please note: The [Kubernetes Plugin for
> Spin](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/spin-plugin-kube/installation/) is a tool designed for
> Kubernetes integration with the Spin command-line interface. The [Kubernetes Plugin for Spin has a
> scaling tutorial](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/spin-plugin-kube/tutorials/autoscaler-support/)
> that demonstrates how to use the `spin kube` command to tell Kubernetes when to scale your Spin
> application up or down based on demand).

## Generate Load to Test Autoscale

Now let’s use Bombardier to generate traffic to test how well HPA scales our SpinApp. The following
Bombardier command will attempt to establish 40 connections during a period of 3 minutes (or less).
If a request is not responded to within 5 seconds that request will timeout:

```console
# Generate a bunch of load
bombardier -c 40 -t 5s -d 3m http://localhost:8081
```

To watch the load, we can run the following command to get the status of our deployment:

```console
kubectl describe deploy hpa-spinapp
...
